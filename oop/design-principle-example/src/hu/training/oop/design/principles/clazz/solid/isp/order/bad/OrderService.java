/**
 * Why ISP is violated here in the order service design? Because,

 * User client - Forced to depend on process order unnecessarily.
 * 
 * Backend job client - only need process order, but still forced to depend on
 * other services too.
 * 
 * Note - To keep example in simplest form, I didn't consider exact low-level
 * API design of the mentioned methods.
